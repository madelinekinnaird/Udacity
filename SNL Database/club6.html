		<h1> Club Description</h1>
		I have the perfect spot. New York&#39;s hottest club is BOOOOOOOOOF. Located in an abandoned orphanage in the Lower East Side of Chelsea, this round the clock puke party is the creation of narcoleptic club owner Snoozan Lucci, and this place has everything: pugs, geezers, doo wop groups, a wise old turtle that looks like Quincy Jones. . .and youâ€™ll have your own When Harry Met Sally moment when you share a special kiss with Gizblow the Coked-Up Gremlin. I&#39;ll have what she&#39;s having.
